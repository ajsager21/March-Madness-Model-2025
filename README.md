# March-Madness-Model-2025
This repository holds my most updated model code and data for the 2024-2025 Men's College Basketball Season. Within it, I was able to accurately predict 79.4% of the games correctly and would have bested the Las Vegas game spread odds in 76.2% of the games. I was also able to create a simulated version of the entire tournament using my XGBoost metrics to predict tournament outcomes that may result from quadrant positionings, otherwise known has harder paths to a championship.
